A value of type @'IO' a@ is a computation which, when performed,
does some I\/O before returning a value of type @a@.

There is really only one way to \"perform\" an I\/O action: bind it to
@Main.main@ in your program.  When your program is run, the I\/O will
be performed.  It isn't possible to perform I\/O from an arbitrary
function, unless that function is itself in the 'IO' monad and called
at some point, directly or indirectly, from @Main.main@.

'IO' is a monad, so 'IO' actions can be combined using either the do-notation
or the '>>' and '>>=' operations from the 'Monad' class.

Note [Kind-changing of (~) and Coercible]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(~) and Coercible are tricky to define. To the user, they must appear as
constraints, but we cannot define them as such in Haskell. But we also cannot
just define them only in GHC.Prim (like (->)), because we need a real module
for them, e.g. to compile the constructor's info table.

Furthermore the type of MkCoercible cannot be written in Haskell
(no syntax for ~#R).

So we define them as regular data types in GHC.Types, and do magic in TysWiredIn,
inside GHC, to change the kind and type.
-}


-- | A data constructor used to box up all unlifted equalities
--
-- The type constructor is special in that GHC pretends that it
-- has kind (? -> ? -> Fact) rather than (* -> * -> *)
data (~) a b = Eq# ((~#) a b)


-- | This two-parameter class has instances for types @a@ and @b@ if
--      the compiler can infer that they have the same representation. This class
--      does not have regular instances; instead they are created on-the-fly during
--      type-checking. Trying to manually declare an instance of @Coercible@
--      is an error.
--
--      Nevertheless one can pretend that the following three kinds of instances
--      exist. First, as a trivial base-case:
--
--      @instance a a@
--
--      Furthermore, for every type constructor there is
--      an instance that allows to coerce under the type constructor. For
--      example, let @D@ be a prototypical type constructor (@data@ or
--      @newtype@) with three type arguments, which have roles @nominal@,
--      @representational@ resp. @phantom@. Then there is an instance of
--      the form
--
--      @instance Coercible b b\' => Coercible (D a b c) (D a b\' c\')@
--
--      Note that the @nominal@ type arguments are equal, the
--      @representational@ type arguments can differ, but need to have a
--      @Coercible@ instance themself, and the @phantom@ type arguments can be
--      changed arbitrarily.
--
--      The third kind of instance exists for every @newtype NT = MkNT T@ and
--      comes in two variants, namely
--
--      @instance Coercible a T => Coercible a NT@
--
--      @instance Coercible T b => Coercible NT b@
--
--      This instance is only usable if the constructor @MkNT@ is in scope.
--
--      If, as a library author of a type constructor like @Set a@, you
--      want to prevent a user of your module to write
--      @coerce :: Set T -> Set NT@,
--      you need to set the role of @Set@\'s type parameter to @nominal@,
--      by writing
--
--      @type role Set nominal@

{-# INLINE isTrue# #-}
isTrue# :: Int# -> Bool   -- See Note [Optimizing isTrue#]
isTrue# x = tagToEnum# x

{- Note [Optimizing isTrue#]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Current definition of isTrue# is a temporary workaround. We would like to
have functions isTrue# and isFalse# defined like this:

    isTrue# :: Int# -> Bool
    isTrue# 1# = True
    isTrue# _  = False

    isFalse# :: Int# -> Bool
    isFalse# 0# = True
    isFalse# _  = False

These functions would allow us to safely check if a tag can represent True
or False. Using isTrue# and isFalse# as defined above will not introduce
additional case into the code. When we scrutinize return value of isTrue#
or isFalse#, either explicitly in a case expression or implicitly in a guard,
the result will always be a single case expression (given that optimizations
are turned on). This results from case-of-case transformation. Consider this
code (this is both valid Haskell and Core):

case isTrue# (a ># b) of
    True  -> e1
    False -> e2

Inlining isTrue# gives:

case (case (a ># b) of { 1# -> True; _ -> False } ) of
    True  -> e1
    False -> e2

Case-of-case transforms that to:

case (a ># b) of
  1# -> case True of
          True  -> e1
          False -> e2
  _  -> case False of
          True  -> e1
          False -> e2

Which is then simplified by case-of-known-constructor:

case (a ># b) of
  1# -> e1
  _  -> e2

While we get good Core here, the code generator will generate very bad Cmm
if e1 or e2 do allocation. It will push heap checks into case alternatives
which results in about 2.5% increase in code size. Until this is improved we
just make isTrue# an alias to tagToEnum#. This is a temporary solution (if
you're reading this in 2023 then things went wrong). See #8326.

-- | @CallStack@s are an alternate method of obtaining the call stack at a given

--
-- When an implicit-parameter of type @CallStack@ occurs in a program, GHC will
-- solve it with the current location. If another @CallStack@ implicit-parameter
-- is in-scope (e.g. as a function argument), the new location will be appended
-- to the one in-scope, creating an explicit call-stack. For example,
--
-- @
-- myerror :: (?loc :: CallStack) => String -> a
-- myerror msg = error (msg ++ "\n" ++ showCallStack ?loc)
-- @
-- ghci> myerror "die"
-- *** Exception: die
-- CallStack:
--   ?loc, called at MyError.hs:7:51 in main:MyError
--   myerror, called at <interactive>:2:1 in interactive:Ghci1
--
-- @CallStack@s do not interact with the RTS and do not require compilation with
-- @-prof@. On the other hand, as they are built up explicitly using
-- implicit-parameters, they will generally not contain as much information as
-- the simulated call-stacks maintained by the RTS.
--
-- A @CallStack@ is a @[(String, SrcLoc)]@. The @String@ is the name of
-- function that was called, the 'SrcLoc' is the call-site. The list is
